  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Trystan, also known as WytchKing or WytchKing96 depending on the platform! I have been an avid gamer for a long time starting back with the N64 and Gameboy Color. I am currently 25 with an amazing Fianc√©e, BewitchingPixel. She is an amazing
    and loving person who is also a fellow gamer and a fantastic creative writer! We are cat-parents to four furry babies: Grimm, Rhaegar, Daenerys, and Bean.</p>
  <p>When it comes to gaming, I definitely try to expand my interests as much as possible. I have grown with Nintendo, Xbox, Playstation, and different PC platforms over the years, finding many games I have come to love from each! At this current
    moment, most of my time is invested in Destiny 2, No Man's Sky, Valheim, and literally any Pok√©mon title. Also, Lord of the Rings online makes the list occasionally when I find the time.</p>
  <p>As for my other interests, I love anything to do with Sci-fi/Fantasy, but nothing will ever truly come close to resonating with me as much as The Lord of the Rings does and anything related to Tolkien's work. I can't get enough of the books, the
    movies, and the games, especially LOTRO which I hope to bring to a stream in the future! Even my Animal Crossing: New Horizons island is to be themed off Middle-Earth. Also, yes, my tag is from The Lord of the Rings as well as I'm a huge fan of
    the Witch King of Angmar as a Villain.</p>
